**Why use our responsive WordPress Contact Form:**

- It's easy to use

This Contact Form 7 or any form builder alternative is very easy to set up. You can quickly create an engaging contact form by using a shortcode and copying it where you want it to appear.

- It's fully customizable

This WordPress Contact Form plugin allows you to customize everything you want. You can change the field labels and decide what message to tell your visitors when an error shows up. You can also decide which fields are required and which are not.

- Provides reCaptcha

Avoid spam messages and make sure the e-mails you receive are entirely addressed to you.

- Comes with SMTP

With the SMTP option, you can be sure you wonâ€™t miss any e-mail from your visitors. The messages will be safely delivered from the source to your personal e-mail address.
If you were using Mandrill's SMTP for transactional emails and contact forms, you should take a look at these <a href="http://www.codeinwp.com/blog/mandrill-alternatives/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mandrill Alternatives</a>.

- Stores contacts in special databases

You can keep all the contacts in an archive by saving their e-mail addresses. Pirate Contact Form allows you to do that by providing contact databases.

A simple to use contact form plugin for creating a clean contact form using the [pirate_forms] shortcode or the 'Pirate Forms' form widget.

- What PirateForms isn't for now


This is not a form maker or drag & drop builder plugin nor "the best contact form plugin", you cannot add new fields or create multiple forms (subscription forms, payment, order, feedback or quote), there are some great alternatives out there for those like : Caldera Forms or Ninja Forms.
